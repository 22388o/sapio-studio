Welcome to tux (transaction ux), a project for visualizing and exploring bitcoin smart contract
trees.

## Getting Started

run `yarn start-react` and then run `yarn start-electron`.


## Connecting With a Contract Server

If you have access to Sapio (or another compatible compiler server), you may connect it via
websocket to tux and it will populate the new contracts and load an example.

If you do not, there are some demos included in the directory examples/data/.

## This is ALPHA SOFTWARE

Expect things to be broken, ugly, and not ready for production.
