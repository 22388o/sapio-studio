Welcome to Sapio Studio, a project for visualizing and exploring bitcoin smart
contract trees built with [Sapio](https://learn.sapio-lang.org).

## Getting Started

```
yarn install
yarn start-react
# in a new tab
yarn start-electron
```


## Connecting With Sapio & Bitcoin

Open the application and configure your preferences for your Bitcoin Node and
Sapio Client.

You will need to load your own contract modules before you can do much.

## This is ALPHA SOFTWARE

Expect things to be broken, ugly, and not ready for production.
