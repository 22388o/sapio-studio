Welcome to Sapio Studio, a project for visualizing and exploring bitcoin smart
contract trees built with [Sapio](https://learn.sapio-lang.org).

## Getting Started

### Make sure you have a Bitcoin node running

Before starting Sapio make sure you have a Bitcoin node running and that you've loaded your wallet
via `bitcoin-cli`.

### Install dependencies

`yarn install`

### Run Sapio

In one terminal run below code: `yarn start-react`

After previous command finishes compiling run: `yarn start-electron`

If `start-electron` command doesn't work you can try: `yarn start-electron --disable-seccomp-filter-sandbox`

## Connecting With Sapio & Bitcoin

Open the application and configure your preferences for your Bitcoin Node and
Sapio Client.

You will need to load your own contract modules before you can do much.

## This is ALPHA SOFTWARE

Expect things to be broken, ugly, and not ready for production.
